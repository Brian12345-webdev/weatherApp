## WeatherApp

# MOTIVATION 
AS A user, I wanted a way to check global weather information based on cities. As A user I wanted to checked weather at any destination prior to traveling to that destination.

# REASON FOR PROJECT 
AS A user, I was lacking informative data about global destinations prior to traveling to any given destination. I found that weather information could aid ina users decision making process.
# PROBLEM_AND_SOLUTION 
THE Problem is as a user, I do not have a weather application that can easily give me the weather information I need to make an informed decision. THE SOLUTION is to develop an application that displays current weather plus 5 additional days of weather data presenting me with temperature, wind speed, and humidity.

# DESCRIPTION 
THIS APPLICATION contains a search input for a user to personally search any given city globally to determine the given destinations weather for 6 days. 6 days of weather include the current day and 5 additional days after. The application also contains quick links for major U.S. cities.
